This program was written to solve a real world problem!

It features Java File I/O as well as a recursive algorithm
to traverse a directory and it's subdirectories.

Apparently MacOS uses right apostrophes rather than regular vertical apostrophes.
This is an issue when you switch over OneDrive from Mac to your superior
Windows machine, expecting to be able to ZIP your project. You will find that
Windows ZIP errors out saying that several files contain an invalid character.

Well, not today! Just enter your your directory or folder path in and the
problem will be fixed.

Now, back to what I was actually trying to do: ZIPping my node.js project
to be able to deploy it to the cloud!

P.S. I do still love Mac, but this was pretty annoying. I couldn't even see
the difference between the Windows and Mac versions of apostrophe... Not to
mention that when I finally noticed a visible difference I discovered I coudln't
just paste in the right apostrophe.. I had to find the unicode value for it.
